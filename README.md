Torchlight Infinite Bot


A TorchlighInfinite bot to autowalk a set path, very very primitive, uses the players coordinates and a waypoint system to walk.
written in AHK 1


 test to read a games player x and y coordinates from memory and tries to walk a recorded path, uses the arrow keys to walk but also work with mouse


insert your own player X and Y memory in here:

```sh
Player_X := 0xYOUR ADRESS
Player_Y := 0xYOUR ADRESS
```
put the name of the exe here
```sh
gameWinTitle := "GAME HERE"
```


also this uses ufloat but you might need to change it
